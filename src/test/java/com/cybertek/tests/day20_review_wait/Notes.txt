    * iframe review
        - What is iframe?
            page in page, HTML inside another html
        - How do you handle iframes? (PIQ)
            we need to switch to <iframe> to be able to do any action on any web element inside of it
        - How many ways do you know to switch
            3 Ways
            1. index
                    driver.switchTo().frame(0)
            2. id, name
                    driver.switchTo().frame("id")
                    driver.switchTo().frame("name")
            3. web element
                WebElement iframeLocator = driver.findElement(By.Locator);
                driver.switchTo().frame(iframeLocator)

TestBase: parent of all the tests in our framework, by extending our test cases
we can easily handle before and after methods of test cases

If you have a WebElement that disappears after some certain time we can stop DOM(HTML) in debug mode:
How: at inspect page, click on Sources, then click F8 button at your computer


Test Case for Practice:
//1. Go to https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_ev_ondblclick2
//2. Switch to iframe.
//3. Double click on the text “Double-click me to change my text color.”
//4. Assert: Text’s “style” attribute value contains “red”.


    * Actions review
           Actions Class: is used for "advanced" mouse and keyboard actions
           * How to use Actions
            1. Create an object of Actions Class
            2. Pass "driver" object as a parameter
            3. USe the object to reach actions methods
            4. We must use perform() method at the end of the statement
            Methods: action.moveToElement().perform();
                     action.doubleClick().perform();

    * POM: Page Object Model review
        What is Page Object Model Design Pattern
            We create JAVA classes for our each page of the project
            We are storing useful WebElements(reusable), methods
        How do we implement POM Design?
            constructor: PageFactory class from Selelnium
            gets two parameters: driver object, this (object of the specific class)
        Advantages:
            - Reusability
            - easy to maintain
            - easy to explain non-technical people
            - handles StaleElement exception, it checks for freshness of the element
