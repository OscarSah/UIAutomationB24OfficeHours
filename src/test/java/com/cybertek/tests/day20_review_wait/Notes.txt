        - What is iframe?
            page in page, HTML inside another html
        - How do you handle iframes? (PIQ)
            we need to switch to <iframe> to be able to do any action on any web element inside of it
        - How many ways do you know to switch
            3 Ways
            1. index
                    driver.switchTo().frame(0)
            2. id, name
                    driver.switchTo().frame("id")
                    driver.switchTo().frame("name")
            3. web element
                WebElement iframeLocator = driver.findElement(By.Locator);
                driver.switchTo().frame(iframeLocator)

TestBase: parent of all the tests in our framework, by extending our test cases
we can easily handle before and after methods of test cases


Test Case for Practice:
//1. Go to https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_ev_ondblclick2
//2. Switch to iframe.
//3. Double click on the text “Double-click me to change my text color.”
//4. Assert: Text’s “style” attribute value contains “red”.

           * How to use Actions
            1. Create an object of Actions Class
            2. Pass "driver" object as a parameter
            3. USe the object to reach actions methods
            4. We must use perform() method at the end of the statement
            Methods: action.moveToElement().perform();
                     action.doubleClick().perform();
